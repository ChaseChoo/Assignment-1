# Assignment-1
I have decided to make a website for basketball merchandise. The site's users are fans and potential fans who wish to purchase basketball related merchandise such as shoes, balls and jerseys. It provides a user-friendly interface for fans to easily make purchases. The website also contains blogs for fans to catch up on latest news at just one click of a button. The white background incites a plain but simple feeling in users. The banners used in the website are all basketball related to show that "Basket" is solely for basketball related content.
